      <h4 class="display-1">About Us</h4>
      <p class="body-1">Our main goal is to create a multi-tier, database web application where members of the Taylor University 
      community can connect with others to plan, and coordinate ride sharing opportunities. Individuals are able to create an
      account, and add themselves to a database that coordinates individuals who need rides, individuals with vehicles, 
      individuals with licenses but no vehicle, and individuals with a vehicle but no license. Therefore, our main goal is 
      to create an application where no matter your driving or vehicle status members of the community can connect with 
      others through ride-sharing opportunities. </p>
